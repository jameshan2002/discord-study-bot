# Discord Study Bot

## Inspiration
We wanted to create a bot that motivates people to study when they cannot be focused. We would try to time ourselves how much we should study, what music should I listen during studying. 

With this bot, it will clear out the distraction to just focus on studying by only using this bot to setup your studying environment.
